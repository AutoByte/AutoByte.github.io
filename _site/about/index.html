      <h1>About C&amp;P Software</h1>

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>C&amp;P Software has been in existence since 2001 and has been a part of several major projects.</p>

<p>Our accomplishements include writting a state of the art real-time air defense system for NORAD, The database interface for an artificial intelligence digital assistant, designing and coding of the initial phase of an automated porting and migration tool and the stabilization of the Sprint PCS Vision system</p>

<h3>Here are some of the core technologies on which C&amp;P Software has developed competence and provided solutions:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>System Architecture & Networking</li>
    <li>Full Stack Software/Hardware Development</li>
    <li>SQL and NoSQL Databases</li>
    <li>Quality Assurance</li>
    <li>System and Stress Testing</li>
    <li>Real-Time Software Design and Construction</li>
</ul>


<h3>C&amp;P likes to abide first and foremost by the medical tenet: First, do no harm.</h3>

<p>Borrowed from the tenets of medicine, this statement is one of the most basic principles of our method of work.</p>

<p>The computer consulting profession exhibits many similarities to the medical profession.  A piece of code may be thought of as a patient, and the consultant as a doctor, or specialist.  Many of the doctrines of Hippocrates can then apply to the consultant.  Taken from his work, “Of the Epidemics”, Book I, Section II, Paragraph 5, one translation reads:</p>

<p>“The physician must be able to tell the antecedents, know the present, and foretell the future - must mediate these things, and have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm.”</p>

<p>Profound in its simplicity, this statement is an excellent guiding philosophy for almost any endeavor.  It suggests that oftentimes, the best course of action may be no action at all.</p>

<p>Paraphrasing for the systems consulting profession: “Document what the software used to do, diagnose and troubleshoot current bugs, and forecast future performance. As to problems, make a habit of two things: to help, or at least to do no harm."  If you were daling with the design of a new system then the paraphrase would be a little different: "Document what the people need, design a solution to the current problems, implement the solution keeping in the mind the future needs.  As to the solution make a habit of helping the people to solve their problem or at least do no harm"</p>
